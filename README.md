# Organizer

This project was created to showcase your skills.
In my work i used RxJS, pipes, a third-party library (momentjs) and also some of the delights of TypeScript

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
